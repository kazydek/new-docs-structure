See how a same docs structure will look like in [GitHub](/github).

Some more details example of subfolders, floating docs, and regular docs is showsn in the [Operational Guides](/04-operational-guides).

Notes:

- Each folder most contain a `metadata.yaml` file that defines its display name.
- Display name of a given doc is defined in its metadata
- Both folders and files will be clickable on the website
- Order of folders and files is alphabetical. It can be modified by adding its preferred position on the left navigation as a prefix (`01`,`12`, etc.).
- "Floating files" refer to the docs that are left loose under a given folder and, most often, are to give some basic info about the given folder or provide some intro to the subfolders.
- [FUTURE?] Unless you specify otherwise in the `metadata.yaml`, if you click on a given node (e.g. tutorials) that has no floating docs, the website will display the first document from the first subfolder on the list
